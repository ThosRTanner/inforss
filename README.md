inforss newsreader for palemoon

## Formatting

Check with care. Formatting validation is done via the various linters provided by codacy

* Javascript: [JS Beautifier](http://jsbeautifier.org/). Settings (currently): 2 space indent, brace on own line, detect packers, space before conditional
* CSS: [CSS beautifier](http://www.cleancss.com/css-beautify/) Settings (currently): 4 space indent, but otherwise pretty much same as JS.
However, the braces on own line doesn't work, so done manually
* XUL - currently cleaned in [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) with 'pretty print xml', followed by 'pretty print xml (attributes)'
