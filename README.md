JS Beautifer: http://jsbeautifier.org/
Settings (currently): 2 space indent, brace on own line, detect packers, space before conditional

CSS http://www.cleancss.com/css-beautify/
Settings (currently): 4 space indent, but otherwise pretty much same as JS.
However, the braces on own line doesn't work, so done manually

JSHint settings. Slowly sorting.
